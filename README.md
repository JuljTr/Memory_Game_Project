# Memory Game Project

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Program, the course included the HTML and CSS files as the starter code.
JavaScript is the primary programming language that was used to built an interactive Web App Memory Game; with Browser Events was added functionality to the game, as every card clicked opens and is matched with the next card. The game is keeping score, has a star point system and at the end of the game the refresh button will render a new game.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
